# most-diacritics
A search for the english word with the most diacritics

## TL;DR:
```
~/words$ python getfinalists.py
Xârâcùù
Mărășești
Mahāmāyūrī
Hárbarðsljóð
Vafþrúðnismál
```

## Note:
This is an extremely badly coded project, i didn't follow any PEP8, this was done at 1am, i was just curious. also, code in releases section

### What this is
So i was trying to find which english word has the most diacritics, i was thinking of the word: naïveté, before i started. 
i made this crude python program, which used wiktionary's data. 

### Result
all the results with 4 diacritics (max) were proper nouns. it's currently 1am and i am too lazy to do it for the 3 marks. i might do it if i have the motivation :shrug:

btw, i made all the code in vim, the first time i've done a project completely using it!
